# 🛡️ Security & Transparency

The **Nexus of Lumina** is a **static frontend portal** with **no backend, no forms, and no data collection**.

### What We Store:
- `localStorage.setItem('portal_visit', timestamp)` — only to mark your visit time (client-side only).

### What We Display:
- Public blockchain addresses (visible on explorers like Tronscan, Snowtrace, etc.).
- These are **intentionally public** — like a digital sigil.

### No Risks:
- No private keys
- No API calls
- No tracking scripts
- No cookies

If you believe you’ve found an issue (e.g., unintended metadata exposure), please open a respectful issue.  
We respond with stardust and gratitude. 🌠
